## HoverBlurr Chrome Extension

Enhance your browsing experience with the HoverBlurr Chrome extension. It dynamically blurs images on web pages and unveils them when you hover over them with your mouse.

### Description

HoverBlurr applies a default blur effect to every image as soon as a web page loads. When you hover your mouse over these images, the blur effect disappears, allowing you to view them clearly. This helps mitigate distractions from various advertisements and other elements during browsing.

### Features

- **Dynamic Blurring:** Automatically blurs images on all web pages by default.
- **Hover to Reveal:** Hovering over an image removes the blur effect smoothly.
- **Customizable Blur:** Users can adjust the blur intensity through the extension's popup.
- **Whitelist Functionality:** Users can whitelist specific websites to exclude them from blurring.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple interface to manage blur settings and whitelist sites.

### Installation

To install the HoverBlurr Chrome extension:

1. Download the extension ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/kamrulhasanio/HoverBlurr-Extension/releases/latest) and unzip it.
2. Open Google Chrome or any Chromium-based browser.
3. Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter.
4. Enable Developer mode from the top-right corner.
5. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder to complete the installation.

### Usage

1. **Blurring Images:**
   - Once installed, you will notice all images on any loaded web page are initially blurred.
   - Hover your mouse over an image to unblur it temporarily. Moving your mouse away will blur it again.

2. **Adjusting Blur Intensity:**
   - Click on the HoverBlurr extension icon to open the popup.
   - Use the slider to adjust the blur intensity. The current blur value is displayed in pixels.
   - The changes are applied immediately to all images on the current page.

3. **Whitelisting Sites:**
   - To whitelist a site, open the HoverBlurr popup and click the "Whitelist Site" button.
   - The current site will be added to the whitelist, and images on this site will no longer be blurred.
   - To remove a site from the whitelist, click the "Remove Whitelist" button.

4. **Managing Whitelist:**
   - The popup displays a list of all whitelisted sites.
   - You can remove a site from the whitelist by clicking the trash icon next to the site in the list.
