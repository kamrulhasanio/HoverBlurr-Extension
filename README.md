### HoverBlurr Chrome Extension

Enhance your browsing experience with the HoverBlurr Chrome extension. It dynamically blurs images on web pages and unveils them when you hover over them with your mouse.

### Description

HoverBlurr applies a default blur effect to every image as soon as a web page loads. When you hover your mouse over these images, the blur effect disappears, allowing you to view them clearly. This helps mitigate distractions from various advertisements and other elements during browsing.

### Installation

To install the HoverBlurr Chrome extension:

1. Download the extension ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/kamrulhasanio/HoverBlurr-Extension/releases/latest) and unzip it.
2. Open Google Chrome or any Chromium-based browser.
3. Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter.
4. Enable Developer mode from the top-right corner.
5. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder to complete the installation.

### Usage

Once installed, you will notice all images on any loaded web page are initially blurred. Hover your mouse over an image to unblur it temporarily. Moving your mouse away will blur it again.
